Data Description: HSall_members.csv

Dataset: Voteview – Members of Congress Data
File used: HSall_members.csv
Provider: Keith T. Poole, Howard Rosenthal, and Voteview.com
This dataset is downloaded from the official Voteview data repository, which provides comprehensive information on members of the U.S. Congress since the First Congress (1789). It contains member-level attributes and ideological scores derived from roll-call voting records.

Conceptual Background
DW-NOMINATE (Dynamic Weighted NOMINAl Three-Step Estimation) is a spatial scaling method developed by Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal. It positions legislators in a multidimensional ideological space based on their roll-call voting behavior.
The first dimension (Dim1) typically represents the economic liberal–conservative continuum.
The second dimension (Dim2) captures social or regional differences, such as North–South divisions in earlier Congresses.

Relevance to Research Question
This dataset is used to analyze whether the 2010 Supreme Court ruling Citizens United v. FEC — which expanded corporate political spending through Super PACs — led to measurable shifts in the ideological positions of U.S. legislators.
Specifically, we examine changes in DW-NOMINATE Dim1 (economic redistribution ideology) before and after the ruling (comparing pre-2010 and post-2010 Congresses).
