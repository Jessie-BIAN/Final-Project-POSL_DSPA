## Project Idea 1

### Question
How have repeated U.S. debt ceiling crises and fiscal instability affected global confidence in the U.S. dollar system between 2000 and 2025? Specifically, does political brinkmanship over federal debt correlate with measurable changes in indicators of dollar dominance—such as the share of global reserves held in USD, foreign holdings of U.S. government debt, and Treasury yield spreads?

### Why It Is Important
The U.S. dollar’s global dominance underpins the international financial order. Yet, recurring political standoffs over the debt ceiling, credit rating downgrades, and rising fiscal pressures may undermine trust in U.S. financial credibility. Understanding whether these events have tangible effects on global confidence in the dollar is crucial for anticipating shifts in the international monetary system and potential diversification toward alternative reserve currencies (such as the euro or renminbi).

### Potential Datasets
This project will combine several publicly available macro-financial datasets:

- **[IMF COFER dataset](https://data.imf.org/en/datasets/IMF.STA%3ACOFER?utm_source=chatgpt.com):**  
  Global currency composition of official foreign exchange reserves.

- **[U.S. Treasury TIC data](https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system?utm_source=chatgpt.com):**  
  Data on foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities.

- **[FRED – Federal Reserve Economic Data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com):**  
  - [Foreign Holdings of Federal Debt (FDHBFIN)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FDHBFIN?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
  - [10-Year Treasury Yield (DGS10)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
  - [Yield Spread (10Y–2Y, T10Y2Y)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
  - [Treasury Constant Maturity Rates (all maturities)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/115?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Analysis Plan
Using **R**, we will construct a time-series dataset from 2000–2025 covering major fiscal and political shocks (e.g., 2011 debt ceiling crisis, 2013 government shutdown, 2023 standoff).  

Analyses will include:

- **Descriptive Statistics:**  
  Visualization of trends in foreign confidence indicators (e.g., USD share of reserves, foreign debt holdings, yield spreads).

- **Event-Study Regression:**  
  Estimating short-term impacts of debt ceiling events on yields and reserve composition.

- **Correlation Analysis:**  
  Measuring associations between U.S. fiscal shocks and shifts in dollar reserve share or foreign holdings.

This empirical analysis will help determine whether U.S. fiscal instability produces measurable erosion in the dollar’s global dominance.
